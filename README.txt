If you have older style switches like Rising Sun RSL366R or Conrad RSL366, don´t throw them away, put them to good use with Homey!

If your switch has manual addressing with House Code (I-IV) and Unit Code (1-4) and Rising Sun or RSL366 printed on it, there is a good chance you can control it with this App.
